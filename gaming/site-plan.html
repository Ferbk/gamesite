It will include several charts to display details related to the worldwide ranking. To be more specific, a chart that has the top10 most played games around the world. If possible, also display charts of the top 10 most played games depending on the country or continent. For this page I will need to do research on my end to find the most updated rankings and surveys around the world, give this information to the user in a way that is attractive to them, so they can stay, and they wanted to come back and keep checking these details, all the information will be updated weekly, and at the end we will have an internal voting using the most 3 played games to have a number 1 within our community, always giving the opportunity to the user to interact with the information, and also at the bottom of the page our social media and links to our discord community.]
